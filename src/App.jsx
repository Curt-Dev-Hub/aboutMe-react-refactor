    text: `My affinity with coding began when I discovered the problem-solving aspect involved in the 
    process of transforming a blank canvas into a working functioning website.
    I find the process of taking an idea, planning the best course of action, and then building a 
    website fit to purpose is very satisfying and allows me to tap into and develop my creative side.
    Around the start of 2019, I had a strong feeling that I wanted to take a new direction, I wanted something 
    that would keep me able to learn new things and expand my knowledge consistently for the foreseeable future, and through self-studies both online and reading programming books and the constantly evolving nature of the tech industry, I had found what I was looking for!
    
    With my strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I'm confident I can bring both my own and your visions to life on the web.                      
    I feel programming, in general, helps to develop logical awareness and planning, to me, this is not just a career, this is also a life skill!

    text: `Being a lover of Music and a bit of an audiophile, I am always seeking out music from 
    various genres in the highest quality audio available. 
    I was introduced to playing the guitar around 2013, which I then continued learning 
    throughout the following years. Although I don't get to play as much as I used to 
    I still own both electric and Acoustic guitars.

    from around the late 90's early 2000's era. I have a modern games console, an Xbox One S 
    which I acquired for a nice price in the 2018 black friday sales. What is my favourite 
    console of all time?? Hmmm, I'd say the Nintendo 64 with the Sega Dreamcast being a very close 2nd.ðŸ™‚`
