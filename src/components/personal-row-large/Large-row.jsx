                    Hello, I'm Curtis, a passionate web developer on a mission to create captivating digital experiences.
                    My coding journey began in August 2018, and since then, my dedication and self-motivation have driven me to pursue coding as my lifelong career choice. 
                    Having amassed valuable insights and skills through diverse roles in my career, 
                    I am now ready to embark on a new venture and establish myself as a sought-after freelance web developer. 
                    I am also open to contract work with a minimum term of 12 months should the right opportunity come.
